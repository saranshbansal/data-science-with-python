We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic (singular) is a number
| computed from a sample of data. We use statistics to infer information about a population. Second, a
| random variable is an outcome from an experiment. Deterministic processes, such as computing means or
| variances, applied to random variables, produce additional random variables which have their own
| distributions. It's important to keep straight which distributions you're talking about.

Finally, there are two broad flavors of inference. The first is frequency, which uses "long run
| proportion of times an event occurs in independent, identically distributed repetitions." The second
| is Bayesian in which the probability estimate for a hypothesis is updated as additional evidence is
| acquired. Both flavors require an understanding of probability so that's what the next lessons will
| cover.
